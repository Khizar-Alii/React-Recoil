Understanding Recoil :
Recoil is a state management library that makes it easy to manage and share state across components in a React application.
Recoil simplifies state management by providing an intuitive and flexible way to manage and share state across your React components.
In a nutshell, Recoil allows you to define atoms and selectors to represent your application's state. Atoms are units of state, while selectors are functions that derive values from atoms or other selectors. By using these Recoil primitives, you can create a centralized store of state that can be accessed and updated from any component in your application.

Here's a quick breakdown of how Recoil works:
1️⃣ Define atoms: Atoms are the building blocks of your application's state. You define atoms using the atom function provided by Recoil. Each atom has a unique key and an initial/default value.
2️⃣ Create selectors: Selectors are functions that derive values from atoms or other selectors. They allow you to compute and transform your state in a declarative way. You can define selectors using the selector function provided by Recoil. Selectors can depend on one or more atoms or other selectors.
3️⃣ Access state with hooks: Recoil provides hooks like useRecoilState and useRecoilValue to access and interact with your state. useRecoilState returns a tuple of the current value and a setter function to update the value, while useRecoilValue returns the current value.
4️⃣ Update state: To update the state, you simply call the setter function returned by useRecoilState or modify the atom value directly. Recoil takes care of efficiently propagating the state changes to all components that depend on it.
5️⃣ Automatic re-rendering: Recoil automatically re-renders components that depend on the state when it changes. This ensures that your UI stays in sync with the latest state without manual event handling or prop drilling.

Recoil offers additional features like asynchronous selectors, snapshots, and more, which you can explore as your application's needs grow.
